eCommerce Website for Knitting - all Credits to Bassir Jafarzadeh

I created this website by following Bassir's guide on UDEMY. Feel free to browse the limited placeholder stock, use the search function, add items to the cart, place orders and generally have a good look around.

There are still a few features I would like to finish implementing and this will be done by the new year.
